    At the moment CodeLists simply map keys to descriptions and
    allow attribute access for easy lookup.  In the future there may be
    more features like short_description, long_description and the
    internal code may differ from the attribute.

     1. Ordered dict
     2. self.items() should return an iterable suitable for sending to django's
        Field.choices argument.
     3. Code can refer to codeList.codename and get back the internal code.
